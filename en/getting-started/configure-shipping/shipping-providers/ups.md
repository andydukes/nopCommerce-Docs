# UPS

## Define the UPS Real Time Shipping Calculations

1. Create a UPS user account via [UPS.com](https://www.ups.com/), then go to [developer.ups.com](https://developer.ups.com/), and create an app to receive the following:
   * Client ID
   * Client Secret
     > [!NOTE]
     > This is to use UPS OAuth, which is required for all new accounts after June 2023, and all accounts after June 2024

2. Add UPS Products to enable shipment tracking, rate calculations, etc. Recommended products are:

   * Rating
   * Address Validation
   * Landed Cost Quoting

3. In the nopCommerce admin area, go to **Configuration → Settings → Shipping Settings**. Configure the shipping point location. The default option is to configure a single **Shipping Origin**, which is configured lower on the page. However you may also choose **Use Warehouse Location**, if you wish to use the settings configured in **Configuration → Shipping → Warehouse**. The **Use Warehouse Location** checkbox is revealed by choosing **Advanced** from the page configuration selector under the **Shipping settings** header.
