# Email accounts

This chapter describes how to set up email accounts associated with your store: a general contact email, a sales representative email, a customer support email, and more.

To manage email accounts, go to **Configuration â†’ Email accounts**. The *Email accounts* window displays the email accounts of the store owner, as shown below. After the email accounts are configured, the store owner can select the required email account on the message template details page as described in the [Message templates](xref:en/running-your-store/content-management/message-templates) chapter.
