# Configure full-text search for your nopCommerce store

Full-text search is a powerful technology that enables users to search through large volumes of text-based data quickly and accurately. Unlike standard nopCommerce search, which relies on exact matches, the Full-text Search analyzes the website's content to retrieve the most relevant results. Auto-complete and typo tolerance optimize search speed and help users find exactly what they need.

nopCommerce Fast Full-text Search is implemented in two plugins:

* [Fast Full-text Search based on Lucene](xref:en/running-your-store/catalog/catalog-settings/full-text-search/lucene-configure)
* [Fast Full-text Search based on Elasticsearch](xref:en/running-your-store/catalog/catalog-settings/full-text-search/elasticsearch-configure)
