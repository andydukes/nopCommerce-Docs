The Omnisend plugin is an out-of-the-box nopCommerce plugin. You can find it here: **Configuration â†’ Local plugins**. To find the plugin faster, use the **Group** field in the search panel to filter the plugins by *Misc* type:

### What data is synced?

The following store data will now be synced to Omnisend:

* Customer details
* Products and viewed categories
* Order-related events
* Abandoned cart-related events

> [!NOTE]
> Manual synchronization should be performed only once, with multiple synchronization, batch insert will report data insert errors. Further synchronization will go automatically and will not require the participation of an administrator

## Contacts sync

Two types of contacts synchronization are implemented in the plugin:

* Initial import of all existing contacts. Performed when the user has just installed the plugin and wants to import all existing store contacts into the Omnisend account.

* Contact synchronization when subscribing/subscribing.

## Customer tracking events (JS snippet)

To track user actions in the store, a JS script is installed on all pages of the site. By default, the script tracks visits to all pages, including tracking visits to the product page. An additional script is also used to notify user identification.

## Cart events, Order events

In the plugin track a number of events to notify the Omnisend service:

* Adding a product to cart.
* Placing an order.
* Payment of an order.
* Order refunded.
* Canceling an order.
* Finalizing the order processing.
* Starting the checkout process.
* Changing a product in the cart (increasing the quantity, discounts, etc.).
* Deleting the last product from the cart.
* Changing the order status.
* Restoring cart. The user has the option to follow the link from the email Omnisend (abandoned cart reminder) to the store.

## Products sync

The plugin implements import of categories and products.
When you click the **Sync products** button, the synchronization process is performed.

> [!NOTE]
> If there are many categories (>300), the user will be shown a warning that the import may take a long time.

In addition to the initial import, real-time synchronization of products is implemented, but only changes in the `StockQuantity` parameter are tracked to keep the product status (*inStock*, *outOfStock*, *notAvailable*) up to date.
